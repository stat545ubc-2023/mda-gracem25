# Grace Melchers' Mini Data Analysis Milestone 1 and 2

This repository contains a mini data analysis assignment for UBC's STAT545A course involving datasets within the package **datateachr**. 

This repository contains three folders -  one is associated with Milestone 1, titled mda1, and contains all of the files associated with that assignment, including the README.md, project .Rmd, .md and image files. The other two folders are associated with Milestone 2. The folder titled mda2 contains most of the files associated with the source of the project, namely the README.md, project .Rmd and .md files. The folder titled output contains the output .csv and .rds files generated when the mda2.Rmd file is knit.

## How to engage with the repository
This repository uses the tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, tidymodels and datateachr packages to explore several datasets and then delves into more detail with one dataset, the vancouver_trees dataset. You can run chunks of code (ideally from top to bottom, otherwise you may get errors, especially if you haven't loaded packages!) to see the results of the code. It utilizes functions such as glimpse, filter, select, ggplot and more.
