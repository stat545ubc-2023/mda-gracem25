# Grace Melchers' Mini Data Analysis
This repository contains a mini data analysis assignment for UBC's STAT545A course involving datasets within the package **datateachr**. At the moment, there are only files associated with Milestone 1 of the assignment, but later it will contain files associated with assignment 2.

The repository is composed of an R Markdown file in which the bulk of the work for this assignment was done, and a knitted Markdown version of that file and the corresponding folder of Markdown-associated files.

## How to engage with the repository
This repository uses the tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2 and datateachr packages to explore several datasets and then delves into more detail with one dataset, the vancouver_trees dataset. You can run chunks of code (ideally from top to bottom, otherwise you may get errors, especially if you haven't loaded packages!) to see the results of the code. It utilizes functions such as glimpse, filter, select, ggplot and more.
